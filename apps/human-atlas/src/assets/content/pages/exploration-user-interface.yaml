        The CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI) represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by multiple coordinate systems, including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. The EUI continues to evolve as more data becomes available. The CCF EUI code is available on <a href = "https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-ui">GitHub</a>.

        - Select Organ: One can navigate available organs by selecting them from the carousel above the stage or using the ontology on the left.
        - Filter: Above the Search is the Filter icon which opens a flyout with many options (e.g. Sex, Assay Types, etc) for refining what tissue data is presented.
        - Registered Blocks: It is possible to select a block of tissue samples either using the bodies on stage or the cards in the right column. Color coding helps to identify  different selections.
        - Data: Using the cards in the right column, click on items to dig deeper into the data.

        - Start: Click the Add Spatial Search button.
        - Select: Choose a donor sex and an organ to explore.
        - Explore: Use the Probing Sphere to explore the organ in 3D Space by colliding with Tissue Blocks. Data updates on the left side menu as Tissue Block collisions are detected.
        - Run Spatial Search: Click the Run Spatial Search button to use the Spatial Location results as a Filter. Add as many Spatial Searches as needed.
        - Apply Filters: Click the Apply Filters button to analyze your Spatial Locations in the Exploration User Interface.
        - Modify Spatial Locations: In the Filters area, Spatial Location results can be selected or deselected using the checkbox. Spatial Locations can be deleted by clicking the trash can icon. Click the Apply Filters button to analyze modified Spatial Locations in the Exploration User Interface.
