        This Registration User Interface (RUI) supports the registration of three-dimensional (3D) tissue blocks within
        3D reference organs. A first beta of the CCF RUI became available in October 2020. 3D reference organs are
        freely available on the HRA Portal in the
        <a href="https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library">
        3D Reference Object Library</a>, the ontology can be found on
        <a href="https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCF">BioPortal</a>, and the code is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-ui">GitHub</a>. The registration data is used in
        current versions of the Common Coordinate Framework and on the
        <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-ui/">Exploration User Interface (EUI)</a> developed within HuBMAP.

      descriptions: |
        - Enter their name to track data provenance.
        - Select a reference organ via the organ carousel (kidney, heart, spleen, colon).
        - Select a set of common tissue extraction sites.
        - Size the tissue block in three dimensions.
        - Enter information on tissue section thickness.
        - Position and rotate the 3D tissue block so that its placement correctly mirrors the tissue block extraction site.
        - Identify anatomical structure tags via collision detection and manual annotation.
        - Save all registration information into a file for easy uploading to custom templates in REDCap (or other systems) used to keep track of tissue and tissue registration data. If using the RUI integrated into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal, registration information is automatically saved with the associated tissue block.
