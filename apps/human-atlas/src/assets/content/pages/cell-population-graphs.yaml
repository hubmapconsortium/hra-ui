        Visualization tool for comparing cell-type distributions from single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from HuBMAP and other public data portals. The number of cells per cell type in a dataset (e.g., derived from a tissue block, tissue section, or biopsy) is visualized as count or percentage in a bar graph. Datasets can be sorted by total cell count or tissue block location (for blocks that were registered via the tissue registration user interface [RUI] into a 3D reference organ model), and they can be grouped by dataset-specific properties (e.g., age, ethnicity, sex, or UV exposure).
