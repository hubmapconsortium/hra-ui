title: Digital Objects
subtitle: The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) is constructed upon a diverse set of Digital Objects (DOs) that encapsulate the anatomical, cellular, and molecular intricacies of the healthy human body.

        Digital Objects serve as the data components used for generating the HRA KG.
        A Digital Object is defined as a unit of information that includes properties (attributes or characteristics of the object)
        and may also include methods (means of performing operations on the object).

        Each Digital Object in the HRA KG is uniquely identified by a Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL).
        This PURL incorporates the digital object's type, name, and version, allowing for reliable access to specific data versions.

        For instance, the PURL https://lod.humanatlas.io/asct-b/kidney/v1.6 identifies the ASCT+B table for the kidney at version 1.6.
        Each digital object is linked to established ontologies such as Uberon, Cell Ontology (CL),
        and Provisional Cell Ontology (PCL) through crosswalk tables, ensuring semantic consistency and interoperability.

          Digital Objects can be categorized into various types, each serving a specific purpose within the HRA KG.
          The primary types of Digital Objects include:

          **ASCT-B**: Represents Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables.
          These tables contain detailed knowledge about human body parts, including AS, CT, and the biomarkers (B) that characterize them.

          **Functional Tissue Explorer (FTU)**: Provides 2D illustrations of Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) structures in an organ, with image assets and cell annotations.
          They illustrate anatomical structures (AS), as FTUs are AS, and the cell types (CT) within them.

          **Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs)**: OMAPs contain panels of antibodies designed to target specific proteins for identifying CT, AS, cell states,
          or cell membrane staining within organs based on experimental projects.
