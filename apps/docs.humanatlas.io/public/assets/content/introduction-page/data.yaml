title: Introduction to HRA Development
subtitle: |
  The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) is a multiscale, three-dimensional, data-rich, open-access atlas of the healthy human body. Designed for researchers, developers, and educators,
  the HRA brings together anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers into a harmonized coordinate system that supports advanced visualization, spatial data integration,
  and computational analysis.

              The HRA supports multiscale modeling from organ systems to single cells. The HRA aims to construct a comprehensive reference model of the healthy human body across all levels,
              from organs and tissues down to cells and canonical biomarkers. Cell types are organized in a multi-level typology, and biomarkers (such as genes, proteins, metabolites, proteoforms,
              and lipids) are also organized in a biomarker typology.

              The HRA supports using 3D models and coordinate mappings to localize biological data. A core component of the HRA is the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF). The CCF helps harmonize multimodal data,
              including 3D organ models, histology images, and omics data. The CCF consists of ontologies, reference object libraries, software, and training materials that enable experts to
              semantically annotate tissue samples and precisely describe their locations in the human body ("registration"), and to align multimodal tissue data from different individuals to a 3D reference coordinate system ("mapping").

              The HRA supports linking anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B). The HRA is built on three core components: anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers - all documented within the ASCT+B tables.
              These tables define the hierarchical “part_of” relationships among organs and tissues, identify the cell types “located_in” each structure, and associate biomarkers that characterize those cell types. Each entity is validated against,
              or contributed to, established biomedical ontologies to ensure semantic consistency. To bridge across systems and modalities, crosswalks link 2D and 3D anatomical structures and cell types with their corresponding ASCT+B terms.

              The HRA combines efforts from NIH, HuBMAP, GTEx, KPMP, SPARC, and more. The HRA is a collaborative effort involving experts from more than 20 consortia. The HRA Working Group brings together technical leads and experimental teams from HuBMAP,
              along with experts from GTEx, GUDMAP, KPMP, BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network Initiative (BICCN), Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet), and other NIH-funded consortia, as well as strong support from the Human Cell Atlas effort (HCA).
              The HRA data, code, and portal infrastructure are developed jointly by these groups.
