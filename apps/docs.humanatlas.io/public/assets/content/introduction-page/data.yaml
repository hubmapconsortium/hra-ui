  Welcome to the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) Developer Documentation!

  The Human Reference Atlas is a multiscale, three-dimensional, data-rich, open-access atlas of the healthy human body.
  Designed for researchers, developers, and educators, the HRA brings together anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers into
  a harmonized coordinate system that supports advanced visualization, spatial data integration, and computational analysis.

  Whether you're building web applications using HRA APIs, visualizing organs in 3D, or contributing your own data and tools to the ecosystem,
  this documentation has everything you need to get started.

          The Human Reference Atlas is a high-resolution, interoperable framework for mapping the human body. It supports:
          - **Multiscale modeling** - from organ systems to single cells.

            The HRA aims to construct a comprehensive reference model of the healthy human body across all levels, from organs and tissues down to cells and canonical biomarkers.
            Cell types are organized in a multi-level typology, and biomarkers (such as genes, proteins, metabolites, proteoforms, and lipids) are also organized in a biomarker typology.

          - **Spatial registration** - using 3D models and coordinate mappings to localize biological data.

            A core component of the HRA is the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF). The CCF helps harmonize multimodal data, including 3D organ models, histology images, and omics data.
            The CCF consists of ontologies, reference object libraries, software, and training materials that enable experts to semantically annotate tissue samples and precisely describe their locations in
            the human body ("registration"), and to align multimodal tissue data from different individuals to a 3D reference coordinate system ("mapping").

          - **Semantic labeling** - linking anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B).

            The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) is built on three core components: anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers - all documented within the ASCT+B tables.
            These tables define the hierarchical “part_of” relationships among organs and tissues, identify the cell types “located_in” each structure,
            and associate biomarkers that characterize those cell types. Each entity is validated against, or contributed to, established biomedical ontologies to ensure semantic consistency.
            To bridge across systems and modalities, crosswalks link 2D and 3D anatomical structures and cell types with their corresponding ASCT+B terms.
            Similarly, Azimuth-derived cell types are mapped to ASCT+B terms and ontology identifiers using these crosswalks, enabling integrated spatial and semantic analysis.

          - **Cross-consortium integration** - combining efforts from NIH, HuBMAP, GTEx, KPMP, SPARC, and more.

            The HRA is a collaborative effort involving experts from more than 20 consortia. The HRA Working Group brings together technical leads and experimental teams from HuBMAP,
            along with experts from GTEx, GUDMAP, KPMP, BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network Initiative (BICCN), Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet),
            and other NIH-funded consortia, as well as strong support from the Human Cell Atlas effort (HCA).
            The HRA data, code, and portal infrastructure are developed jointly by these groups.

          Ready to dive in? Here's how you can begin using the Human Reference Atlas tools:

          - **[Browse 3D Organs](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library)** in the Reference Library.
          - **[Query spatial ontologies](https://humanatlas.io/api)** using the API.
          - **[Visualize tissue registration](https://registration.humanatlas.io/)** with the Registration User Interface.
          - **[Use web components](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-ui)** to embed HRA visuals in your own platform.
