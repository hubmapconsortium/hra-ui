title: Design System
subtitle: |
  A unified visual and interaction framework for all Human Reference Atlas applications.

  Designers use [Figma's design system file structure](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14552802134807-Lesson-1-Welcome-to-design-systems) to create reusable components,
  patterns, and styles that ensure consistency across the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) applications.

          The **Human Reference Atlas Design System** includes a documented and interactive component library available in **Storybook**.

          Developers can explore, test, and integrate reusable UI components consistently across all HRA applications.

          - Each component has its own page with configurable props and usage examples.
          - Components align with the HRA design patterns and color guidelines defined in **Figma**.
          - Stories are organized by categories such as **Buttons**, **Forms**, **Navigation**, and more.
          - The Storybook is automatically updated with new components and changes from the design system.
          - **Stories** are linked to their corresponding Figma designs for easy reference.

          Designers rely on **Figma** as the single source of truth for all websites and applications built around the Human Reference Atlas (HRA).

          The HRA Design System is structured into three main elements, each organized by page for clarity and reuse.

          Designers organize the **Component Library** in Figma by categories for easy navigation and developer handoff.

          Each component is associated with a corresponding application screen or UI pattern, helping ensure traceability from design to implementation.

        Once a component is finalized in Figma, designers initiate a formal handoff to developers in the [Human Reference Atlas Component File](https://www.figma.com/design/BCEJn9KCIbBJ5MzqnojKQp/HRA-Components?node-id=2-841).

        1. A designer submits a **GitHub issue** to indicate that it is ready for development, with the following details:
            - A description of the component and its interactions
            - Links to relevant Figma pages
            - Any accessibility or responsive behavior notes

        2. A developer uses the issue to:
            - Implement the component in code
            - Integrate it into the **HRA Storybook Design System** for visibility and reuse

        This collaborative handoff ensures that visual fidelity, interaction behavior, and accessibility are maintained across the design and development cycle.
