  The Human Resource Atlas (HRA) Knowledge Graph (KG) integrates anatomical structures, cell types,
  and biomarkers across the healthy human body into a unified, semantically-rich data graph designed for querying, visualization,
  and analysis.

  The current version of the HRA-KG encompasses:
  - 71 distinct human organs
  - 5,800 detailed anatomical structures
  - 2,268 precisely classified cell types
  - 2,531 rigorously defined biomarkers
  - 10 million nodes interconnected by 171 million edges
  - Approximately 126 GB of graph data

  The Knowledge Graph supports semantic queries, detailed analytics, and seamless integration with external applications and platforms.

        The Human Reference Atlas Knowledge Graph (HRA-KG) can be accessed programmatically via a SPARQL endpoint or a RESTful API with
        client libraries in JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and Python. Interactive access is also available through web-based user interfaces.
        All data follows Linked Open Data principles and supports standard RDF formats.

          A standards-compliant SPARQL 1.1 endpoint is available for executing custom semantic queries over RDF data.
          This interface provides full graph access, including support for content negotiation to retrieve data in various RDF serialization formats.

          Here's a sample query that retrieves the **count of 3D anatomical structures** from the HRA Knowledge Graph.

          ```
          #+ summary: Count of 3D Anatomical Structures
          #+ description: Count of 3D Anatomical Structures

          PREFIX ccf: <http://purl.org/ccf/>
          PREFIX HRA: <https://purl.humanatlas.io/collection/hra>

          SELECT (COUNT(?as3d) as ?as_count)
          FROM HRA:
          WHERE {
            SELECT DISTINCT ?as3d WHERE {
              ?as3d ccf:has_reference_organ ?y .
              FILTER(!CONTAINS(STR(?y), '/united-'))
            }
          }
          ```

          To execute this query, use the following cURL command:

          ```bash
          curl -L -g "https://grlc.io/api-git/hubmapconsortium/ccf-grlc/subdir/hra/as-3d-cnt"
          ```

          The response will return the count of 3D anatomical structures in the graph, like this:

          ```
          as_count
          1295
          ```

          The HRA API provides a simplified REST interface for accessing HRA-KG content without requiring knowledge of SPARQL.
          It exposes key endpoints like anatomical structures, cell types, spatial references, and datasets.

          Official client libraries are available to streamline access to the HRA-KG through the REST API.
          These libraries simplify tasks such as querying endpoints, handling authentication (if applicable),
          and processing responses in application development environments.

          Libraries are available for:

          -	JavaScript / TypeScript
          -	Angular 17+
          -	Python 3.6+

          These tools support ontology browsing, data inspection, and semantic navigation without requiring SPARQL or API interaction.

          Several browser-based tools enable visual exploration of HRA-KG data and its associated ontologies.
