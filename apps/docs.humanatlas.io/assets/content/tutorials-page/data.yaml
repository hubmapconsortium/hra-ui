          The HRA Tutorials are a curated set of Jupyter notebooks designed for developers, researchers, and students who want to explore and work with the Human Reference Atlas programmatically. These tutorials assume no prior knowledge of the HRA ecosystem and are written to guide first-time users through real-world workflows such as querying data, exploring anatomical structures, and integrating 3D and semantic data into applications.

          Each notebook focuses on a specific use case and builds on the previous one, making it easy to follow along in sequence. You can run these notebooks locally or in Google Colab.

          ### HRA API Tutorial
          **What you'll learn:**
          - How to connect to the HRA API
          - How to fetch and filter Digital Objects (DOs)
          - How to retrieve metadata for anatomical structures, cell types, and reference organs

          This is the best place to start if you're new to the HRA and want to explore the data programmatically.
