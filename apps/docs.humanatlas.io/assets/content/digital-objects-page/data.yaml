        Digital Objects serve as the data components used for generating the HRA KG.
        A Digital Object is defined as a unit of information that includes properties (attributes or characteristics of the object)
        and may also include methods (means of performing operations on the object).

        Each Digital Object in the HRA KG is uniquely identified by a Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL).
        This PURL incorporates the digital object's type, name, and version, allowing for reliable access to specific data versions.

        For instance, the PURL [kidney (v1.6) graph data](https://lod.humanatlas.io/asct-b/kidney/v1.6) identifies the ASCT+B table for the kidney at version 1.6.
        Each digital object is linked to established ontologies such as Uberon, Cell Ontology (CL),
        and Provisional Cell Ontology (PCL) through crosswalk tables, ensuring semantic consistency and interoperability.

          Digital Objects can be categorized into various types, each serving a specific purpose within the HRA KG.
          The primary types of Digital Objects include:

          High-resolution, anatomically accurate 3D models of human organs, derived from sources like the Visible Human Project. These models provide spatial context for tissue registration and data visualization, supporting formats such as GLB and OBJ.
          Each 3D model object is annotated with a proper label and an identifier from the Uberon and FMA ontologies. They are used in HRA applications to register and explore tissue blocks and associated datasets.

          The Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables contain detailed knowledge about human body parts in a hierarchical order, explaining the organization of Anatomical Structures (AS), the Cell Types (CT) found in each AS, and the Biomarkers (B) that distinguish each CT.
          These tables are foundational for semantic annotation, linked to other digital objects via crosswalks and are available in CSV format.

          These mappings associate cell types identified in external datasets (e.g., Azimuth) with standardized HRA terms, facilitating cross-dataset comparisons and analyses.
          They enhance interoperability between diverse single-cell datasets. They are referenced by other digital object types to annotate AS, CT, and B with ontology terms and they can be downloaded as CSV and XLSX files.

          OMAPs consist of curated panels of antibodies designed to target specific proteins for identifying cell types, anatomical structures, cell states, or cell membrane staining within organs.
          They are essential for standardized multiplexed tissue imaging.
