    A functional tissue unit (FTU) is the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function
    and is replicated multiple times in a whole organ. Explore medical illustrations of FTUs to view cell type populations
    by gene, protein, and lipid biomarkers. The FTU Explorer features experimental datasets from
    <a href='' target='_blank'>HuBMAP</a>, <a href='' target='_blank'>CellxGene</a>, <a href='' target='_blank'>NeMO</a>,
    and <a href='' target='_blank'>GTEx</a>.

    The 2D Functional Tissue Unit Library provides anatomically correct illustrations of functional tissue units (FTUs).
    The illustrations are developed by a specialist in 2D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.
    Illustrations are created using terms from the Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarker (ASCT+B) table for each organ.
    Subject matter experts collaborate on a list of anatomical structures and/or cell types to be included in each FTU.
