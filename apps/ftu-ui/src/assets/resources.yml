LandingPageIntroDescription:
  type: markdown
  markdown: |
    A functional tissue unit (FTU) is the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function
    and is replicated multiple times in a whole organ. Explore medical illustrations of FTUs to view cell type populations
    by gene, protein, and lipid biomarkers. The FTU Explorer showcases single-cell expression data from the <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/updates-from-data-resources/anatomograms-new-feature-single-cell-expression-atlas/' target='_blank'>Anatomogram</a> site by EMBL-EBI.

  markdown: |
    The 2D Functional Tissue Unit Library provides anatomically correct illustrations of functional tissue units (FTUs).
    The illustrations are developed by a specialist in 2D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.
    Illustrations are created using terms from the Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarker (ASCT+B) table for each organ.
    Subject matter experts collaborate on a list of anatomical structures and/or cell types to be included in each FTU.

    Expression is scaled linearly to the range [0,1].
    Scaling is done by designating the minimum value in the current view to 0 and the max is assigned to 1.

    The percentage of cells in the FTU is calculated by dividing the total number of
    cells in all FTUs by the number of all cells in that tissue section.
