        Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information technologies,
        no transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
        While Indiana University is committed to protecting user privacy,
        IU cannot guarantee the security of any information users transmit to university sites,
        and users do so at their own risk.

        - Once we receive user information, we will use reasonable safeguards consistent with prevailing industry standards and
        commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being stored to maintain the security of that information on our systems.
        - We will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding the privacy and security of user information.
