          Format and upload spatial data and explore resulting visualizations:

          - This app reads spatial data mapped to X-Y coordinates for 2D and X-Y-Z coordinates for 3D along with their associated cell types, generating cell-cell distance distribution visualizations for analyses.
            - Spatial data could include cells, cell types, and anatomical structures (e.g., functional tissue units), and cell types and morphological features (e.g., the edge of an organ), or any other data with X-Y coordinates or X-Y-Z coordinates.
          - This app can be used to add granularity to our understanding of how disease develops (e.g., how tumor cells grow or metastasize) in support of targeted therapies.
