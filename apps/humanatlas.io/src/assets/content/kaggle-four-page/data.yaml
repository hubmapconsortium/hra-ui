          Participants are asked to segment blood vessels.
          Participants will create a model trained on 3D Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) data from
          human kidneys to help complete a picture of vasculature throughout a body. This work will better researchers' understanding of the size,
          shape, branching angles, and patterning of blood vessels in human tissue.
