        ASCT+B tables represent cell-by-gene (CxG) relationships that are also captured in the HuBMAP Azimuth references.
        This site provides the cell-type typology for all existing Azimuth annotated reference datasets;
        the Azimuth cell-type typology trees can be visualized in the ASCT+B Reporter.

        We also provide easy access to results for comparing CxG in ASCT+B vs. CxG in Azimuth.
        In January of 2022, Azimuth supports single-cell RNA-seq data exclusively.
        As more experimental data becomes available and additional types of data are supported (e.g., proteins, lipids, metabolites),
        data differences will decrease.

        In November of 2022, 10 Azimuth molecular reference maps for the human are available.
        For each, we provide the cell-type typology as a file that can be visualized in the ASCT+B Reporter together
        with a table that lists the annotation level and the number of cell-types for each unique cell in the organ-specific
        Azimuth reference.

        The below table shows the comparison of the CxG matrix in ASCT+B tables vs. CxG matrix in Azimuth for each organ in January 2022.
        An automatically generated, up-to-date comparison is available for download here; this XLS file also contains separate sheets with
        cell-types that are not (yet) covered in the ASCT+B tables. Details on how the comparison is calculated are on GitHub.
        Note that not all Azimuth cell types have CL IDs; in these cases, matching is done based on cell-type names.

        Data from Azimuth Website GitHub Repository has been parsed to derive cell-type typologies:
