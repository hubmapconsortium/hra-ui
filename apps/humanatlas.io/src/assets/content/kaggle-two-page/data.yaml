          This challenge asks participants to develop models that can accurately identify and segment functional tissue units
          (FTUs)—the cellular neighborhoods that perform key functions—across five human organs using tissue section images.
          By improving FTU detection methods that generalize across organs and datasets, participants contribute to building a
          Human Reference Atlas that could transform how we understand and improve human health at the molecular level.
