        Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) Tables aim to capture the nested part_of structure of human organ systems
        from gross anatomical structure scale to subcellular biomarker scale. Functional tissue units (FTUs) for an organ system are identified
        as well as the typology of cells and biomarkers used to uniquely identify cell types within that organ system (e.g., gene, protein,
        proteoforms, lipid or metabolic markers). Ontology terms and unique identifiers are matched to AS, CT, and B wherever possible for semantic
        search capability within Human Reference Atlas apps. This data is authored and reviewed by an international team of anatomists, pathologists,
        physicians, and other experts and it used to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) of the healthy human body.

        The ASCT+B Reporter is a visualization app to explore, compare, and construct Human Reference Atlas digital objects ASCT+B Tables and Organ
        Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). This app includes a partonomy tree that presents relationships between various anatomical structures and
        substructures, that are linked to their respective cell types and biomarkers via bimodal networks. This app also presents an indented list
        view of the partonomy tree and lists statistics for various metadata (e.g., counts of ASCT+B Table entity types and relationship types) which
        are downloadable. The debug log lists any issues related to the data provided in the table. This app has a backend server, the ASCT+B API, to
        retrieve the data from Google Sheets and convert it to a machine-readable format.

          The ASCT+B Reporter currently supports comparing:
          - ASCT+B Tables to ASCT+B Tables
          - ASCT+B Tables to experimental data
          - ASCT+B Tables to OMAP Tables

          1. In the ASCT+B Reporter application, click the Compare button in top toolbar to open the Compare side panel.
          2. Use templates to format data into an ASCT+B Table or an OMAP Compare Table.
          3. Add data to compare in two ways:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Upload an ASCT+B Table or OMAP Compare Table CSV or XLSX,</li>
                <li>Add the URL of a publicly accessible Google Sheet.</li>
            </ol>
          4. Optional: Add a title and description for the dataset.
          5. Optional: Select a color for visualizing the data.
          6. Optional: Add more datasets by clicking the Add button, then repeat step 1 and step 2 for each additional dataset.
          7. Click the Compare button to generate the visualization to start comparing.
