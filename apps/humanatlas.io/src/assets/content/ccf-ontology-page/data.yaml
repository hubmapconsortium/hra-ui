title: Common Coordinate Framework Ontology
subtitle: A Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) for a human body provides a unique address for each cell in the human body. It is similar to the latitude-longtitude system used to navigate a world map.

        The Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) Ontology<sup>1</sup> provides standard terminologies and data structures for describing specimens,
        biological structures, and spatial positions of tissue blocks and organs linked to existing ontologies.

        With HRA v2.1 (https://humanatlas.io/release-notes/v2.1, June 2024), CCF Ontology v3.0,
        the embedded HRA data was removed andthe CCF Ontology now cleanly describes the HRA vocabulary.
        Concretely, the HRA v2.1 uses the CCF Ontology v3.0 vocabulary with HRA-specific classes and instances from
        HRA-curated Digital Objects (DOs) resulting in the HRA (https://purl.humanatlas.io/collection/hra/v2.1).

        Prior to this (HRA v2.0), CCF Ontology v2.3.0 published in the 6th HRA release (Dec 2023) provides vocabulary for HRA plus
        embedded HRA v2.0 data used in HRA applications and interfaces<sup>2</sup>.
        The same was true for all HRA versions prior to 2.0.

        CCF v3.0 details key vocabulary for six types of HRA-curated DOs (ASCT+B tables, OMAPs, 2D and 3D reference objects,
        Cell Type Annotation Crosswalks, vascular geometry, and dataset-graphs).
        About 10,000 experimental datasets have been linked to the HRA with the HRA Cell Type Populations graph (hra-pop),
        which is also part of the HRA KG (https://purl.humanatlas.io/graph/hra-pop).
        Named graphs provide information on data coverage. In total, HRA KG has 41 classes and 73 properties.

        Additionally, the HRA KG hosts other reference ontologies as mirrors, including UBERON, Cell Ontology,
        and the CCF so that they can be queried together at https://lod.humanatlas.io/vocab.

        The HRA v2.1 (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/HRA) as well as
        the CCF Ontology v3.0 (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCF) are available via BioPortal,
        the world's most comprehensive repository of biomedical ontologies.

        The HRA 3D Reference Objects are also hosted by NIH 3D, an open, community-driven portal to download, share,
        and create bioscientific and medical 3D models for 3D printing and interactive 3D visualization,
        including virtual and augmented reality (https://3d.nih.gov/collections/hra).
