title: Functional tissue unit (FTU) illustrations
subtitle: A functional tissue unit (FTU) is the smallest tissue organization that
  performs a unique physiologic function and is replicated multiple times in a whole organ.
  Functional tissue unit illustrations may be used to explore cell type populations by gene,
  protein, and lipid biomarkers in the Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) Explorer app.

        Functional tissue unit illustrations are anatomically correct illustrations of
        functional tissue units (FTUs). The illustrations are developed by a specialist in
        2D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.

        Illustrations are created using terms from the Anatomical Structures,
        Cell Types, and Biomarker (ASCT+B) table for each organ. Subject matter experts collaborate on
        a list of anatomical structures and/or cell types to be included in each FTU.
        Histology atlases and data sets are consulted for visual reference, and research is undertaken to
        determine if cell sizes and their relative number and distribution is known for a given FTU.
        Reasonable estimates are made when placing cells in the illustration and relating them to a scale bar.

        A crosswalk table is then created for each FTU illustration, linking the terms in the ASCT+B table to the
        individual cells in the illustration. This provides an opportunity to add interactive functionality and extends the
        potential uses for each FTU.
