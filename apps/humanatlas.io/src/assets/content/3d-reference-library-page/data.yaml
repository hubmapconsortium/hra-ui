        The HRA 3D Reference Object Library provides anatomically correct reference organs.
        The organs are developed by a specialist in 3D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.

        Initially, reference objects are created using data from the Visible Human male and female datasets
        provided by the National Library of Medicine.
        The male dataset comprises 1,871 cross-sections at 1mm intervals for both CT and
        anatomical images at a resolution of 4,096 pixels by 2,700 pixels.
        The female data set has the same characteristics as the Visible Human Male
        but axial anatomical images were obtained at 0.33 mm intervals
        resulting in 5,189 cross-section anatomical images.
        The male was white, 180.3 cm (71 inch) tall, 199 pounds, and was 38 years old.
        The female was white, 171.2 cm (67.4 inch) tall, obese, and 59 years old.

        On March 12, 2021, a total of 11 reference organs became available in GLB format.
        Each organ can be viewed and explored using free web browsers such as Babylon.js.
        Screenshots and major properties of the nested reference organ objects are given in the table below.

        For selected organs, 3D extraction site objects are provided.
        Some extraction sites resemble geometric objects (e.g., cuboids for heart)
        while others take the shape of one or more whole or
        partial anatomical structures (e.g., in spleen).
        The 3D extraction sites do not restrict registration to specific regions,
        instead they provide “expert defined landmarks” to help guide tissue registration.
        The extraction site objects are also used for automatic semantic annotation of tissue samples
        via collision detection during registration.

        In the 71 3D Reference Objects of HRA v2.2,
        a total of 1,295 modeled 3D structures are tagged with an ontology ID in UBERON or FMA.
        The crosswalk that links 3D structures (called nodes in the crosswalk)
        to their ontology ID is available on the HRA LOD Server.
