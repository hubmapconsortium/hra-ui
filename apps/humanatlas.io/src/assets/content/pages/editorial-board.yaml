        The HRA editorial board is composed of interdisciplinary experts from pathology, surgery, and single cell experimentalists.

        The board will meet virtually every six monthsâ€”in Nov and May of each yearâ€”to

        - advise on setting HRA editorial policies,
        - suggest future HRA extensions (e.g., crosswalks between ASCT+B tables and Azimuth references or OMAPs),
        - select organ-specific editors that invite high-quality submissions/revisions of HRA digital objects and administer the peer review of submissions,
        - optimize incentive structures (e.g., HRA papers in major journals, awards for highest-quality contributions by organ teams/editors/reviewers),
        - discuss commercial and other means to sustain the HRA effort beyond current NIH funding, and
        - act as ambassadors for the HRAâ€”promoting the HRA at relevant conferences and within key communities.
