          Compare FTUs in terms of cell types and mean biomarker expression levels for healthy reference tissue.
          The FTU Explorer showcases single-cell expression data from the [Anatomogram](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/updates-from-data-resources/anatomograms-new-feature-single-cell-expression-atlas/) site by EMBL-EBI.
          The FTU Explorer was designed in close collaboration with the Kidney Precision Medicine Project and the European Bioinformatics Institute.
