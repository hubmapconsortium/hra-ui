          OMAPs are combinations of antibodies that define cell populations, cell states, and anatomical structures reproducibly in diverse human
          tissues using multiplexed antibody-based imaging. Each OMAP is tailored to a tissue and/or organ of interest (e.g., kidney, lymph node),
          multiplexed imaging method (e.g., IBEX, CODEX), and tissue preservation method (e.g., fixed frozen, FFPE). The OMAP initiative emerged
          from the Affinity Reagents Working Group within the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) Consortium and parallel efforts in the field
          of cytometry to construct peer reviewed Optimized Multicolor Immunofluorescence Panels (OMIPs).

          OMAPs provide experimental details relevant for their successful application (e.g., tissue preservation method, imaging method,
          antigen retrieval conditions, and antibody cycling order). The end result is an assembly of expertly curated antibodies that work together
          in a single tissue section. By analogy, OMAPs are recipes and validated antibodies are ingredients. See for validated antibody resources:
          the [HuBMAP Antibody Validation Report](https://avr.hubmapconsortium.org/) and [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue).

          HuBMAP is focused on collecting OMAPs for healthy human tissues in support of a Human Reference Atlas (HRA). However, we will support OMAPs
          designed for diseased human tissues and consider OMAPs designed for use in experimental animal model systems or organoids.

          An ideal panel will be as comprehensive as possible (40-60 markers or more as technology advances). However, we welcome OMAPs that capture
          most anatomical structures and cell types present in a tissue and, at a minimum, allow for the characterization of 10 biomarkers in a single
          tissue section.

          Please follow the instructions in the [SOP: Construction of Organ Mapping Antibody Panels for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Tissues](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5749882).
          All OMAPs require the completion of the following:

          (1) an OMAP Table based on standardized criteria specified in Table 2 Metadata Schema for OMAP Table columns in the SOP;

          (2) OMAP Description Document that includes a brief description of the OMAP, links to relevant protocols and publications, and details related to antigen retrieval conditions and image analysis workflows, if applicable;

          (3) an Antibody Validation Report (AVR) for each antibody included in your OMAP as outlined on the [HuBMAP AVR website](https://avr.hubmapconsortium.org/)
          (HuBMAP membership for Globus login is required); and

          (4) a link to dataset(s) employing your OMAP via a public data repository (Zenodo) or the [HuBMAP data portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/).

          We strongly recommend that you format your antibody panel using the
          [OMAP Table Template](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/omap-extras/omap-table-template.xlsx).
          The metadata captured by our OMAP template conform to journal reporting standards and are recommended for reproducible multiplexed
          tissue imaging ([Schapiro et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01415-4); [Hickey et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01316-y)).
          This can be included as a supplementary table and/or dataset (CSV) file.

          By publishing OMAPs on the HuBMAP HRA portal, we aim to highlight useful resources that may be missed in the methods and supplementary
          tables of most manuscripts. We appreciate the time and dedication it takes to construct an OMAP de novo and hope that the HuBMAP HRA
          Portal will provide greater visibility for your work while helping others with their multiplexed imaging studies.

          No, we will accept OMAPs created for ongoing work as long as authors provide links to publicly available protocols, preprints,
          and datasets, (e.g., protocols.io, bioRxiv, and Zenodo). These requirements help facilitate external review of OMAPs and cultivate
          community confidence in OMAPs. We welcome unpublished OMAPs authored by industry leaders as long as relevant protocols and representative
          datasets are provided.

          Yes, please cite the original OMAP as a foundation and detail changes in the OMAP Description Document—e.g., additional antibodies included,
          alternative clones used, changes to the order in which antibodies are applied (if applicable), or conjugation kits used. Additionally,
          the OMAP may be designed for a different sample type (e.g., FFPE if the original is for fixed frozen) or health state (e.g., aging,
          malignancy if the original is for a healthy adult). In the latter example, the new OMAP must describe the unique cell types and cell states
          not covered by the existing OMAP for that tissue or organ. The expanded OMAP will receive a new number ID and DOI.

          Yes, if an existing OMAP has minor revisions to correct small changes to formatting or typos. Versioning is done through the GitHub
          repository for Human Reference Atlas (HRA) release. The OMAP maintains its original OMAP ID (Example: OMAP-1).
