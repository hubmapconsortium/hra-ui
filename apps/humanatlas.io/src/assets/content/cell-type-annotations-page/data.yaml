        Azimuth[1], CellTypist[2,3], Popular Vote (popV)[4], and other cell type annotation tools let users upload a sc/snRNA-seq dataset and
        output a cell type name for each cell in the dataset. The number and type of cell types these cell type annotation tools can assign differs
        among tools and when compared to the number of cell types recorded in the ASCT+B Tables, see Summary Statistics adopted from a related preprint[5].
        Note that ASCT+B tables keep track of cell types per anatomical structure (AS) while cell type annotation tools use organ-level data.

        Cell Type Annotation crosswalks are used in the HuBMAP, SenNet portals, HRApop, and the Azimuth website.

        Note that ASCT+B Tables are versioned and revised with each new HRA release in June and December as new terms are added to Uberon and Cell Ontology;
        thus, the crosswalks are revised as needed, versioned, and republished with each HRA release.

        To map cell type labels to standardized Cell Ontology (CL) labels and CL IDs used in ASCT+B Tables, crosswalk tables for Azimuth, CellTypist, and
        Popular vote (popV) were constructed. Use tool-specific crosswalk tables:
