        Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables aim to capture the nested part_of structure of
        anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and the biomarkers used to identify cell types (e.g., gene, protein,
        lipid or metabolic markers). The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of anatomists, pathologists,
        physicians, and other experts.

          The below table lists for each organ the number of anatomical structures (#AS), the number of cell types (#CT), the number of
          biomarkers (#B), the number of part_of relationships between AS, the number of located_in links between CT and AS, and the number of
          CT and B (i.e., which B characterize a CT). Biomarker abbreviations: genes (BG), proteins (BP), metabolites (BM), proteoforms (BF), and lipids (BL).
