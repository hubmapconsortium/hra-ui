  description:
    - title: The **Human Reference Atlas (HRA)** is a multiscale, multimodal, three-dimensional atlas of the anatomical structures and cells in the healthy human body. The HRA provides standard terminologies and data structures for describing specimens, biological structures, and spatial positions linked to existing ontologies.
