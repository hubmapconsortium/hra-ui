          Participants will segment instances of microvascular structures, including capillaries, arterioles,
          and venules and create a model trained on 2D PAS-stained histology images from healthy human kidney tissue slides.
          Automating the segmentation of microvasculature structures help will improve researchers' understanding of
          how the blood vessels are arranged in human tissues.
