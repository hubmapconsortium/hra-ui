          - List navigation: Browse, select, show, and hide anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers with their nested tree listings in the left side menu.
          - Filter: Open filter options (e.g. sex, assay types, etc) to refine the 3D scene viewer and data results on the right side menu.
          - Selecting tissue blocks: It is possible to select a block of tissue samples either using the bodies on stage or the cards in the right side menu.
            Color coding helps to identify different selections.
          - Registered data: Dig deeper into the source data with the cards in the results list on the right side menu.

          Spatial search is a way to filter data specific to one organ:
          1. Click the Spatial Search button in the 3D scene or the “Add Spatial Search” button in the filter menu.
          2. Select a donor sex and an organ.
          3. Use the Probing Sphere to explore the organ in 3D space by colliding with tissue blocks. As tissue block collisons are detected,
             relevant data updates on right side menu.
          4. Click the Run Spatial Search button to use the current spatial location results as a filter. Add as many spatial search filters as needed.
          5. Click the Apply Filters button to analyze the selected spatial locations in the Exploration User Interface's default view.
          6. Modify spatial locations as needed by opening the filter menu. Spatial locations can be hidden or shown. \
             Spatial locations can be deleted by clicking the trash icon button. Click the Apply Filters button to apply modified spatial locations.
