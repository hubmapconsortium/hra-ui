          The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), sponsored by the NIH, is building an open,
          cellular-level map of the human body—starting with the kidney—similar to how the Human Genome Project mapped DNA.
          In this competition, “Hacking the Kidney,” the challenge is to detect functional tissue units (FTUs) across varying tissue
          preparation methods to support breakthroughs in health, anatomy, and disease understanding. Successful submissions are showcased
          to expert judges and contribute vital tools, data, and insights that fuel research, therapy development, and public understanding
          of human biology. This competition concluded on May 21, 2021.
