      The HRA editorial board is composed of interdisciplinary experts from pathology, surgery, and single cell experimentalists.

      The board will meet virtually every six months—in Nov and May of each year—to

      - advise on setting HRA editorial policies,
      - suggest future HRA extensions (e.g., crosswalks between ASCT+B tables and Azimuth references or OMAPs),
      - select organ-specific editors that invite high quality submissions/revisions of HRA digital objects and administer the peer review of submissions,
      - optimize incentive structures (e.g., HRA papers in major journals, awards for highest quality contributions by organ teams/editors/reviewers),
      - discuss commercial and other means to sustain the HRA effort beyond current NIH funding, and
      - act as ambassadors for the HRA—promoting the HRA at relevant conferences and within key communities.
