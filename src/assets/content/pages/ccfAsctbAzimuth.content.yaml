  subtitle: Crosswalks from Azimuth cell annotation tool to ASCT+B tables will cell population data

overviewAzimuthData:
- heading: Overview
  descriptions: |
    <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-anatomical-structures.html" target="">ASCT+B tables</a> represent cell by gene (CxG) relationships that are also captured in the organ-specific HuBMAP <a href="https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/" target="_blank">Azimuth references</a>.
    This site provides cell type typology data from Azimuth that can be visualized in the <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/" target="">ASCT+B Reporter</a>.

    We also provide easy access to results for comparing CxG in ASCT+B vs. CxG in Azimuth. In Jan 2022, Azimuth supports single-cell RNA-seq data exclusively. As more experimental data becomes available and additional types of data are supported (e.g., proteins, lipids, metabolites), data differences will decrease.

  descriptions: In Jan 2022, eight molecular reference maps for human are available via Azimuth. For each we provide the cell type typology as a file that can be visualized in the ASCT+B Reporter together with a table that lists the annotation level and the number of cell types for each unique cell in the organ-specific Azimuth reference, see Table 1.

    Table 3 shows the comparison of the CxG matrix in ASCT+B tables vs. CxG matrix in Azimuth for each organ in Jan 2022. 
    An automatically generated, up-to-date comparison is available <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/asctb-azimuth-data-comparison/Azimuth_vs_ASCTB.summaries.xlsx">here</a>; this xls also contains separate sheets with cell types that are not (yet) covered in the ASCT+B tables. 
    Details on how the comparison is calculated are on <a href="https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/asctb-azimuth-data-comparison" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Note that not all Azimuth cell types have CL IDs; in these cases, matching is done based on cell type names.
