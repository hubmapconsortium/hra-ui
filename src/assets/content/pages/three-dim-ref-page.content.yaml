  subtitle: Open source 3D organs crosswalked to ASCT+B tables used for tissue registration and exploration

- heading: Overview
  descriptions: |
    The CCF 3D Reference Object Library provides anatomically correct reference organs. The organs are developed by a specialist in 3D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.

    Initially, reference objects are created using data from the Visible Human male and female datasets provided by the National Library of Medicine. The male dataset comprises 1,871 cross-sections at 1mm intervals for both CT and anatomical images at a resolution of 4,096 pixels by 2,700 pixels. The female data set has the same characteristics as the Visible Human Male but axial anatomical images were obtained at 0.33 mm intervals resulting in 5,189 cross-section anatomical images. The male was white, 180.3 cm (71 inch) tall, 199-pound and was 38 years old. The female was white, 171.2 cm (67.4 inch) tall, obese, and 59 years old.

    On March 12, 2021, a total of 11 reference organs became available in GLB format. Each organ can be viewed and explored using free web browsers such as Babylon.js. Screenshots and major properties of the nested reference organ objects are given in the table below.
    
    For selected organs, 3D extraction site objects are provided. Some extraction sites resemble geometric objects (e.g., cuboids for heart) while others take the shape of one or more whole or partial anatomical structures (e.g., in spleen). The 3D extraction sites do not restrict registration to specific regions, instead they provide “expert defined landmarks” to help guide tissue registration. The extraction site objects are also used for automatic semantic annotation of tissue samples via collision detection during registration.

    A listing of organs and body systems is here: <a href="https://github.com/cns-iu/ccf-organ-vr-gallery/blob/main/CCF3DOrganGallery/Assets/Resources/Body_Systems_List.csv" target = "_blank">https://github.com/cns-iu/ccf-organ-vr-gallery/blob/main/CCF3DOrganGallery/Assets/Resources/Body_Systems_List.csv</a>

    The 3D Models were created by Kristen Browne for the 3D Printing and Biovisualization program operated by OCICB, NIAID. This research has been funded in part by the NIH Common Fund through the Office of Strategic Coordination/Office of the NIH Director under award OT2OD026671, by the NIDDK Kidney Precision Medicine Project grant U2CDK114886, and NIAID under BCBB Support Services Contract HHSN316201300006W/HHSN27200002 to MSC, Inc; U.S.

    The male colon is from a white 55-year-old and was provided by Arie Kaufman, Stony Brook University.
    
    The brain is from a 34-year-old female donor and was published by the Allen Human Reference Atlas-3D, 2020. Jim Gee, University of Pennsylvania converted the NII file into GLB. Amy Bernard, Allen Institute assisted in mapping the 141 anatomical structures to the brain ASCT+B table

    The lymph node models were created using the Clearing-enhanced 3D (Ce3D) method developed by Dr. Weizhe Li, Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH using data documented in https://www.pnas.org/content/114/35/E7321. While the size and cellular composition of mouse and human lymph nodes varies between species, the overall anatomy is well-conserved.
