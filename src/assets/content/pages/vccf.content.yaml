    descriptions: The Human Reference Atlas-Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework (HRA-VCCF) dataset is the first open, computer-readable, and comprehensive database of the adult human blood vasculature. 
      It contains a list of blood vessels and their branching relationships, as well as associated cell types and biomarkers, the vessel type, anastomoses, portal systems, microvasculature, functional tissue units, 
      links to 3D reference objects, vessel geometries (length, diameter), and mappings to anatomical structures the vessels supply or drain. This database is used to derive the blood vasculature ASCT+B table; and, 
      it can be used as a coordinate system for describing the location within the body--a Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework (VCCF).
