  title: Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework
  subtitle: The first open, computer-readable, and comprehensive database of the adult human blood vasculature

overviewData:
- heading: Overview
  descriptions: The Human Reference Atlas-Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework (HRA-VCCF) dataset is the first open, computer-readable, and comprehensive database of the adult human blood vasculature. It contains a list of blood vessels and their branching relationships, as well as associated cell types and biomarkers, the vessel type, anastomoses, portal systems, microvasculature, functional tissue units, links to 3D reference objects, and mappings to anatomical structures the vessels supply or drain. Future versions will add variants, vessel geometries, and other properties. This database is used to derive the blood vasculature ASCT+B table; and, it can be used as a coordinate system for describing the location within the body--a Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework (VCCF).

    This research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health Human BioMolecular Atlas Program
    (HuBMAP) award OT2OD026671. We thank Zorina Galis for presenting us with the initial idea of using a
    Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework (VCCF) as a coordinate system for the human body and helpful
    suggestions and comments on constructing the HRA-VCCF database; Fauzan Isnaini for his contributions
    to modeling the vasculature in functional tissue units; and, Kristen Browne for creating the 3D
    reference objects.
