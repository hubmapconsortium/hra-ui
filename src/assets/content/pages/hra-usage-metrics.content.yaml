    The RUI is deployed in the HuBMAP Ingest Portal and used to add standardized spatial and biological structure (ASCT+B aligned) annotations. The EUI is available via Data Portal. ASCT+B terms are used by Vitessce to assign ontology-aligned cell type annotations for Azimuth cell by gene annotations and soon CODEX cell type annotations.

    **Monthly users, if applicable (based on one or more of the following: monthly downloads from websites, monthly downloads from package managers, monthly unique requests for updates, etc.)** 
    There are about 4,400 papers citing “gtex portal” in Google Scholar. There are 28,000 results in Google Scholar citing “gtex”.
    
    We have an average of 20,000 users and 160,000 pageviews per month, based on Google Analytics data. It is difficult for us to track the number of monthly downloads, as our files are stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and it is difficult for us to track downloads from GCS. Our downloads page has approximately 6,500 pageviews per month. 
    Some of those pageviews may result in 0 file downloads while others may result in multiple file downloads.


    **Software Projects that depend on the project**
    API is public and allows for anonymous access, so it is hard for us to know which software
    projects depend on the GTEx Portal. We do know that the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem Portal will be using our gene expression API to display gene expression data. 
    The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) uses our API to retrieve summary data about our samples. Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have developed internal applications that depend upon our API, including Novo Nordisk. 
    Our top referrals are from <a href="https://genecards.org">https://genecards.org</a>, which displays GTEx gene expression data and provides links back to the GTEx Portal.

    **Monthly visitors to project's website, discussion forum (e.g., Stack Overflow)**
    The number of monthly visitors to the web site is 20,000, based on Google Analytics data.

    ## CCF UI (RUI + EUI + WCs) Requests for May
    HuBMAP ID Generator is in the ingest portal. Those numbers are artificially high because the google analytics for the RUI actually starts when they go to the site May 2022:
