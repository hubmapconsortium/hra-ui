  title: CCF Anatomical Structures, Cell Types and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) Tables
  subtitle: Data tables containing hierarchical anatomical structures, cell types and biomarkers from the Cell Ontology

overviewData:
- heading: Overview
  descriptions: Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables aim to capture the nested <i>part_of</i> structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types (e.g., gene, protein, lipid or metabolic markers). The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of anatomists, pathologists, physicians, and other experts.

existingTablesData:
- heading: Existing Tables
  descriptions: The below table lists for each organ the number of anatomical structures (#AS), the number of cell types (#CT), the number of biomarkers (#B), the number of <i>part_of</i> relationships between AS, the number of located_in links between CT and AS, and the number of CT and B, i.e., which B characterize a CT.

    The <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/">CCF ASCT+B Reporter</a> makes it possible to explore tables visually—per organ or across all organs in support of table authoring and review. It combines two different types of Angular visualizations: A partonomy tree of anatomical structures and bimodal networks that link anatomical structures to cell types and cell types to biomarkers.

- heading: ASCT+B Table Ontology Validation Reports
  descriptions: ASCT+B table drafts are run through a Python script called <a href="https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-validation-tools" target="_blank">CCF_Tools</a> each week. The script reads them in, compares them against the Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple store database called Ubergraph (Uberon and Cell Ontology), and outputs a validation report that can be used to improve tables during creation or revision cycles.

  descriptions: |
    The initial release of ASCT+B tables (v1.0) included 11 organs. In the 2nd release, 14 additional tables were published bringing the total to 25. In the 3rd release, several tables were updated and placenta was added resulting in 26 tables. In the 4th release, 13 tables were revised based on external reviews and updated to add ontology mappings where previously absent.
