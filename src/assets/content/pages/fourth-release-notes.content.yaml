    **Introduction**

    HuBMAP's Indiana University Mapping Component (MC-IU) has published the 4th Release of the Human Reference Atlas (v1.3), a digital atlas of the human body that lets users query & explore key anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers down to the cellular level.

    **What's New**

    * The Human Reference Atlas now includes **57 reference organs** with **1,588 anatomical structures**.
    * **The following reference organs were added:** 
        * left/right female mammary glands
        * update to skin to accommodate addition of mammary glands and future skeletal muscle additions in legs
        * landmark organs added for mammary gland registration user interface (RUI) support: sternum, manubrium, xiphoid process, axillary tail of breast, lower outer quadrant of breast, lower inner quadrant of breast, upper outer quadrant of breast, lower inner quadrant of breast
    * **13 ASCT+B tables were revised:** blood; blood vasculature; bone marrow; brain; eye; heart; large intestine; lymph vasculature; ovary; pancreas; small intestine, spleen; thymus
    * **19 2D functional tissue unit (FTU) reference illustrations were added** to support Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) Explorer.
        * **kidney:** nephron, renal corpuscle, cortical collecting duct, outer medullary collecting duct, inner medullary collecting duct, thick ascending loop of Henle, thin ascending loop of Henle, thin descending loop of Henle
        * **large intestine:** crypt of Lieberkuhn
        * **liver:** liver lobule
        * **lung:** alveoli, bronchial submucosal gland
        * **pancreas:** acinus, islets of Langerhans, intercalated duct
        * **prostate:** prostate glandular acinus
        * **skin:** epidermal ridge, dermal papilla
        * **thymus:** thymus lobule

    **ASCT+B Tables**

    What is an ASCT+B table? 26 tables describe human anatomy, connect Anatomical Structures to Cell Types to Biomarkers.

    **ASCT+B Ontology Validations**

    How are ASCT+B Tables validated? We use Ubergraph to check all relationships experts have asserted in the tables against established ontologies (namely Uberon and Cell Ontology). Check out the results in GitHub.
