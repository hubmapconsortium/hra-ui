  description: `
  The 2D Functional Tissue Unit Library provides anatomically correct illustrations of functional tissue units (FTUs).
  The illustrations are developed by a specialist in 2D medical illustration and approved by organ experts.
  Illustrations are created using terms from the Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarker (ASCT+B) table for each organ.
  Subject matter experts collaborate on a list of anatomical structures and/or cell types to be included in each FTU
