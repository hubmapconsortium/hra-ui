Purpose: Short, actionable guidance for AI coding agents working in this monorepo.

Overview

- This repository is an Nx monorepo containing many Angular apps (under `apps/`) and shared libraries (under `libs/`). Most apps are Angular 20 projects built with the `@nx/angular` plugin.
- Key patterns: generator defaults use `standalone: true`, `changeDetection: OnPush`, and `style: scss` (see `nx.json` "generators").

Quick commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install` at repo root.
- Serve an app locally: `npx nx run <app-name>:serve` or `nx serve <app-name>` (example: `npx nx run cde-ui:serve`).
- Build an app: `npx nx build <app-name>` (targets use configurations from `nx.json`).
- Run tests: `npx nx test <project>`; CI config uses `nx test --configuration=ci` when present.
- Storybook: `npx nx run <project>:storybook` (port defaults to 4400 per `nx.json`).

Architecture notes (what matters)

- Apps are self-contained Angular applications under `apps/`. Shared UI and logic live in `libs/` (e.g., `libs/design-system`, `libs/ccf-shared`).
- Build defaults and base paths are configured in `nx.json` target defaults. Production `baseHref` is `/ui/{projectName}/` — assume asset paths follow this base in production.
- Web components / WC builds: there is a `build-webcomponent` target; some apps produce a single `wc.js` in `dist/.../browser/wc.js`.
- Custom tool/plugin points: `tools/esbuild-plugins/disable-code-splitting.mjs` and the custom Nx plugin `@hra-ui/zod-to-json-schema` are used in build flows — inspect `tools/` when modifying build behavior.

Developer conventions and patterns to follow

- Change detection: components are always `OnPush` and always `standalone`. Prefer isolated, pure inputs and immutable patterns using Angular signals.
- Styles: global include paths reference `libs/design-system/styles` (see `targetDefaults` in `nx.json`). Use SCSS and the shared tokens.
- Libraries: follow existing naming and export patterns in `libs/`; prefer adding small reusable components to `libs/design-system` rather than app-specific copies.
- Deprecated libraries: **Do not reference these in new code** — `libs/ccf-shared`, `libs/ftu-ui-components`, and `libs/shared/utils` are deprecated and planned for removal. If equivalent functionality is needed, prefer `libs/design-system`, create a focused `libs/<new-lib>` or ask maintainers for guidance.
- Tests: Jest is used across the workspace (see root `jest.config.ts` and per-project configs). Many projects set `passWithNoTests: true` in `nx.json` so run specific project tests rather than relying on a global run.
- Use `@testing-library/angular` for unit tests: import and use `render()` from `@testing-library/angular` and assert via DOM queries (e.g., `screen.getByText`) instead of accessing the Angular `fixture` or component internals from the rendered result. This keeps tests resilient and aligned with existing project patterns.
- Test setup helpers: When tests require repeated, large `render(...)` blocks (lots of `providers`, `imports`, `declarations`, or common stubs), factor them into a `setup()` helper function that returns the `render` result and common helpers (for example: `{ renderResult, screen, user }`). Keep the helper in the test file to make test files concise and maintainable.
- Zod imports: Always import zod using `import * as z from 'zod';` — this ensures zod imports are tree shakeable.

Integration and external dependencies

- Backend / API client: projects import `@hra-api/ng-client` to communicate with HRA APIs. When adding or updating API usage, check `libs/` for shared wrappers.
- Large visualization libs: `deck.gl`, `three`, and `@google/model-viewer` are used in visualization apps — be mindful of bundle size and the `disable-code-splitting` plugin.
- CI and code quality: CI references `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (also referenced as `sharedGlobals` in `nx.json`) and SonarCloud badges in the README — keep changes test-covered and linted.

Where to look first (useful files)

- `nx.json` — target defaults, build configurations, generator defaults.
- `package.json` — dependency matrix and dev tooling (nx, jest, storybook, husky).
- `apps/<app>/project.json` — app-specific build/serve/test targets and options.
- `libs/design-system` and `libs/ccf-shared` — canonical UI patterns and shared utilities.
- `tools/` — custom build plugins and scripts that change bundling behavior.

When making changes

- Prefer small, focused changes that update the library under `libs/` and then wire the app `project.json` to use it.
- Update `project.json` and `tsconfig.*.json` only for the specific project unless a workspace-wide change is required.
- Run the same Nx target you changed locally to verify (e.g., `npx nx build <project> --configuration=development`).

Examples (templates for common tasks)

- Serve app: `npx nx run cde-ui:serve` — used for local debugging of `cde-ui`.
- Build for production: `npx nx build cde-ui --configuration=production` — consult `nx.json` for `baseHref` behavior.

If something isn't discoverable

- Open `apps/<app>/project.json` and `libs/<lib>/project.json` — targets and custom executors live there.
- Ask the repo maintainers for infra details (deploy targets and environment values) if CI-only configs are referenced but not present locally.

Feedback

- If anything here is unclear or you need deeper details (CI, deployment, or specific app boot sequences), ask and I will expand this file with concrete examples and links.
